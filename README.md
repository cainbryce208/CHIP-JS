# C-HTTP (CHIP) 
C-HTTP (CHIP) is a highly configurable library for NodeJS that expands the basic features of the HTTP web server
 ## Main Focus / Features
 the main focus of CHIP is to streamline a very basic but highly configurable HTTP server with NodeJs. 
 # The features
 1) streamlined pages/views. pop your .html or any supported file.
 2) along with the automatic indexing/parsing of views. by default, a route is generated for the view.
 3) extensive logging for rich feedback on data or to hunt those "features" ;) . through this, you can easily create DOM based event handlers without making a unique script or value for it!
 4) 
 # These features are present in many other frameworks
 but the idea with CHIP is to bring everything down to as minimal and simple as possible.
